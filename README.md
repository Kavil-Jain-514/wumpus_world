# wumpus_world
Wumpus World is a classic artificial intelligence problem with a simulated environment to test and refine reasoning and decision-making algorithms. Introduced by Alfred V. Aho, Jeffrey D. Ullman, and John E. Hopcroft in 1974, it remains a foundational concept in AI.

The Wumpus World is a simulated environment consisting of a grid, where each cell represents a room. The objective is for an intelligent agent to navigate through the grid, avoiding dangers and finding the gold. The environment includes the following elements:

Agent: The intelligent agent, often represented as an arrow, explores the Wumpus World and makes decisions based on sensory information.

Wumpus: A mythical creature, the Wumpus, resides in one of the rooms. If the agent enters the Wumpus's room, it is eaten, and the game ends.

Pits: Some rooms contain bottomless pits. If the agent enters a room with a pit, it falls in, and the game ends.

Gold: The agent's objective is to find and retrieve the gold placed in one of the rooms.

Breeze: A breeze is present if a pit is in an adjacent room. The agent can sense the breeze.

Stench: A stench is present if the Wumpus is in an adjacent room. The agent can sense the stench.

Glitter: The agent can sense glitter in a room if gold is present.

Percept: The agent receives perceptual information about the current room, such as whether it perceives a breeze, stench, or glitter.

The agent must decide which rooms to enter, where to move, and when to grab the gold based on its sensory information. The challenge is to develop an intelligent strategy that allows the agent to navigate the Wumpus World successfully while avoiding dangers and achieving its objective.

Wumpus World is a valuable testbed for exploring various AI concepts, including search algorithms, knowledge representation, and logical reasoning. It provides a controlled environment to evaluate the effectiveness of different AI techniques in solving complex problems.
